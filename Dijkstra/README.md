# Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm In Java
By Nihar Mitra for AP CS

## Introduction

## Specification
Implement a method that takes an adjacency matrix representation of a graph, a starting node, and runs Dijkstra's algorithm on it, returning an ordered collection representing the sequence of vertices as determined by Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Current Issues

## Structure

## Challenges
