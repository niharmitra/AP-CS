# Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm In Java
By Nihar Mitra for AP CS

## Introduction

## Specification
Implement a method that takes an adjacency matrix representation of a graph, a starting node, and runs Dijkstra's algorithm on it, returning an ordered collection representing the sequence of vertices as determined by Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Current Issues

## Structure

## Challenges

James Ngo checked code  
Rafi Long Looked at his code for guidance, explained some apsects of Dijkstra's algorithm, edited README.md against my will  
Julian Could'Knodt resist learning from my extensive kngoledge (is also proof I didn't cheat)
